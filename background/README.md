# BertFineTuning
## Project Overview
This project aims to fine-tune a pre-trained <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf">BERT</a> (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model which was proposed in October 2018 by Google for duplicate/similarity detection using Quora Question Pairs dataset. 

The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset has been the subject of a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs">Kaggle competetion </a> in 2017 and a wealth of information is publicly available peertaining to this dataset. The dataset consists of question pairs extracted from Quora.com and made available by the same company(<a href="https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs">QQP</a>).
